## Postman Demo ##
These are the few issues that I have often observed when running a demo of the cache service in Postman
  - A Signed In Postman user
  - Postman Desktop / Web Application
  - Issues with Environment variables

### Starting with the Postman Demo ###
Pressing the "Run in Postman" button, will take you to the "Fork the collection in your worksapce" screen. (You can try that ...)

My suggestion is to press the "View Collection" link that, which will take you the Collection page like this one

Since the Web Demo works in cluster mode to demostrate the distributed servers, CH algo, etc., open the folder "Cluster" and have an initial feel of the APIs in them

*At this point, you should be Signed In otherwise Postman will NOT allow you to send API requests*
